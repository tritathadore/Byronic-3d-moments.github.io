You can check that an operation, moment, or circuit is valid on a particular `cirq.Device` by using `validate_operation`, `validate_moment`, or `validate_circuit` respectively. You can also create your own custom device objects to specify constraints for a new or changed device. Device objects, custom and otherwise, also can carry around metadata that may be useful for the validation process or other processes."
